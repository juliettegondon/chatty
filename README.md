### LESSONS LEARNED
for this project, I wanted to have a simple Chatbot using react that I can use and modify in future projects. The greatest challenge here was keeping this simple, and not getting too intensely wrapped up in styling and all the icing on top. My major takeaway for this project was that there is a lot of value in getting comfortable with documentation. Besides the React documentation, which I always have open when coding React Apps, I also had the documentation for the Chatbot handy to learn its capabilities!
